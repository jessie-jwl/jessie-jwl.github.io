Uneven work division and assignment can demotivate group members as no matter how much workers contribute individually, the entire group can end up with sharing the same outcome, rendering individual contributions invisible and unaccountable. 
While fair division of outcomes or costs have been studied extensively as an optimization or economic problem, there remains limited understanding how group members negotiate the division and assignment of work in collaborative settings, and how to better support such negotiations toward prioritizing an equity strategy that would take individual differences and diversity into fairness consideration. 
In this project, we proposed to support fair work assignments in groups with a work division dashboard that displays information on 
(1) equal division: system recommendation of how to equally divide work (which may not be equitable), and 
(2) group awareness of accountability: visualization showing how individual members' contributions added up as group outcome. 
We recruit 60 participants to play a group Tetris game using different versions of the dashboard, offering novel understandings on how system recommendation and accountability affect fairness perceptions, group productivity and the adoption of more equitable strategies in work assignment.
