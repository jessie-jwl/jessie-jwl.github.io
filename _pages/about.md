I am a computer science PhD student from UC Davis CSC (Collaborative and Social Computing) Lab, led by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](https://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research focus is in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing. Currently, my work is focusing on facilitating fairness in group work, especially on the workload division process within groups.

Before I join UC Davis, I did my undergrad at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan with the major of Quantitative Finance, and my masters at Columbia University with the major of Applied Analytics.
