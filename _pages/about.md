I am a computer science PhD student from UC Davis CSC (Collaborative and Social Computing) Lab, advised by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](https://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research focus is in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing. Currently, my work is focusing on facilitating fairness in group work, especially on the workload division process within groups. Most of my work involves translating real-world scenarios into gameplay, where I invite participants to engage in these scenarios. I then study how different UI designs can influence their perceptions or motivations.

Before I join UC Davis, I received my bachelor degree in Quantitative Finance from National Tsing Hua University, and my masters degree in Applied Analytics from Columbia University.

**[Recent Ongoing Projects: Signal/EEG Data Analysis]**

â€¢ [**i-care, an interface for caregiver**](https://citris.ucdavis.edu/news/citris-supported-caregiving-project-moves-simulation-pilot-study)
Improve caregiver-elder connections that uses vibration data instead of camera images to monitor elder's activities.

**â€¢ EEG and Human Perceived Fairness in the Workload Division Process**
Evaluate the impact of UI designs on user cognitive load and engagement in the workload division process with electroencephalogram (EEG).

**â€¢ EEG and human cognitive process of writing fake reviews**
Measuring EEG signals to understand the cognitive patterns and emotional responses associated with the act of deception, uncovering how neurological factors influence the creation of misleading content.
