I am a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at UC Davis in the Collaborative and Social Computing Lab, advised by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang]. (https://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research bridges Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing, with a particular focus on fairness in group collaboration. Currently, I study how workload division impacts group dynamics by designing experimental systems that simulate real-world collaboration. These systems generate rich behavioral datasets, which I analyze using statistical modeling, data visualization, and computational methods to uncover patterns in decision-making, fairness perceptions, and motivation. My work highlights how data-driven insights from user behavior can inform the design of interfaces and algorithms that support fair and effective collaboration.

Before I join UC Davis, I received my bachelor degree in Quantitative Finance from National Tsing Hua University, and my masters degree in Applied Analytics from Columbia University.

**[Recent Ongoing Projects: Signal/EEG Data Analysis]**

â€¢ [**i-care, an interface for caregiver**](https://citris.ucdavis.edu/news/citris-supported-caregiving-project-moves-simulation-pilot-study)
Improve caregiver-elder connections that uses vibration data instead of camera images to monitor elder's activities.

**â€¢ EEG and Human Perceived Fairness in the Workload Division Process**
Evaluate the impact of UI designs on user cognitive load and engagement in the workload division process with electroencephalogram (EEG).

**â€¢ EEG and human cognitive process of writing fake reviews**
Measuring EEG signals to understand the cognitive patterns and emotional responses associated with the act of deception, uncovering how neurological factors influence the creation of misleading content.
