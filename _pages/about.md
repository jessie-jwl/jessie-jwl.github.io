I am a computer science PhD student from UC Davis CSC (Collaborative and Social Computing) Lab, advised by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](https://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research focus is in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing. Currently, my work is focusing on facilitating fairness in group work, especially on the workload division process within groups.

Before I join UC Davis, I received my bachelor degree in Quantitative Finance from National Tsing Hua University, and my masters degree in Applied Analytics from Columbia University.
