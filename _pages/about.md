I am a computer science PhD student from UC Davis CSC (Collaborative and Social Computing) Lab, led by [Prof. Hao-Chuan Wang](https://www.haochuanwang.info/). My research focus is in Human-Computer Interaction, Computer-Supported Cooperative Work, and Social Computing. Currently, my work is focusing on facilitating fairness in group work, especially on the workload division process.
